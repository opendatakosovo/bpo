            <div class="modal-body">
                <p>The Online Media Review is a geospatial and actor-based database that contains incident information
                pertaining to the level of political violence, terrorism, safety and security, and natural and
                human-induced hazards in Bangladesh. The database is populated daily using openly available information
                published by the online media both in English and Bangla. The pilot dataset presented in the Bangladesh
                Peace Observatory Platform covers the time period of June 2015 - August 2016.</p>

                 <p>The database consists of a number of layers of information pertaining to each incident reported in the
                online media; types, triggers or motivations, consequences for each incident (such as death, injury and
                property damages), actors, and sources. The publication of the data is for pilot purposes, and there may
                be errors in data collection, validation and/or reporting by the media.</p>

                 <p>For the purpose of this pilot database project, the following online media have been reviewed:
                thedailystar.net; Banglanews24.com; bdnews24.com; Daily-sun.com; dhakatribune.com;
                thefinancialexpress-bd.com.Other online media reviewed with less frequency are en.prothom-alo.com;

                include political parties and all their allied organizations such as volunteer, youth and
                worker groups.</p>
                <p class="disclaimer-point"><strong>2. Terrorism and radicalism:</strong> includes incidents involving Islamist organizations, rebel and militant
                groups (non-political party) who use violence and intimidation for political or religious aims,
                and in many cases are proscribed by the government as terrorist groups.</p>

                <p class="disclaimer-point"><strong>3. Safety and security</strong> – incidents related to 1) security and crime, or other forms of homicide which
                includes non-politically motivated crimes such as robbery and theft, vandalism, etc.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="modal-body">
                <p>The Print Media Review Database (PMRD) identifies and codes events of political violence in Bangladesh
                from print media content analysis. The aim of the PMRD database is to capture to the best possible
                extent of as many instances and reliable information pertaining to political violence incidents in the country.
                The PMRD is managed by the Microgovernance Research Institute (MGR) at University of Dhaka, and covers
                political violence incidents for the period of 2014 – 2016.</p>


                <p>Events have been coded from four different national printed newspapers: Daily Star, Inqilab, Ittefaq and
                Prothom Alo. They have been chosen for a combination of circulation, reputation, ideological position, network of
                correspondents and language. All newspapers have regional correspondents, often up to the Upazila,
                or Union level, enabling them to cover a wide range of local events. To be included in the database
                a coded event must be</p>
                <p class="disclaimer-point"><strong>1) violent:</strong> resulting in at least one injured/ death/raped/abducted/held hostage or in property
                destruction and</p>
                <p class="disclaimer-point"><strong>2) explicitly political: </strong> involving members of at least one clearly delineated political group: political
                party and all its allied organizations, Islamist organization, or rebel group.</p> <p>A violent event is coded as a single event if:</p>
                 <p class="disclaimer-point">1) It takes place on the same day</p>
                 <p class="disclaimer-point">2) It takes place at the same place,</p>
                 <p class="disclaimer-point"> 3) It involves the same actor (if only one actor is involved) or at least two of the same actors
                throughout.</p>

               <p><strong><i>Coding, variables and post processing</i></strong></p>
                Coding in the PMRD is based on a detailed codebook, listing the different variables, and codes to denote
                specific places up to sub-districts, diverse actors, types of violence, range of violence trigger,
                human impact, property destructions,, etc. The codebook aimed at minimizing interpretation of reports
                by the data analysts. The DAs have been recruited from Dhaka University students focusing on their
                capacity building.
                <p>They have gone through several intensive training workshops, exercise session and piloting before
                they finally start the reading and entries. DAs are assigned a specific newspaper and a specific time
                period, rotating between newspapers after every three-month period.
                The PMRD is a compressive database covering diverse range of actors, violence categories, determinants,
                triggers and consequences. However, Bangladesh Peace Observatory (BPO) platform covers following
                political violence categories.</p>

                <p class="disclaimer-point">1. Political clash/attack: Violent clashes/battle and attack in which actors from general political
                parties, affiliated organizations, identity groups and alliances are directly involved and define the
                fighting and violence. It covers both intra-party clashes and inter-party attacks.</p>


                <p class="disclaimer-point">2. Violent extremism (Islamist): Political violence perpetrated by the Islamists radical outfits around
                the country with political and religious aims. It includes incidences of attack and killing online
                activists, bloggers, foreigners, atheists, and sufists around the country.</p>

                <p class="disclaimer-point">3. Violent extremism (Rebel): Political violence perpetrated by ultra-left ideological groups and ethnic
                rebels around the country.</p>

                <p class="disclaimer-point">4.Electoral violence: Political violence between different actors related to elections at local,
                regional and national levels. It includes elections as the direct trigger or direct cause of the
                violent event.</p>

                <p class="disclaimer-point">5. Hartal violence: Political violence incidences as part of a clearly mentioned hartal day(s).</p>

                <p class="disclaimer-point">6. Destruction of property (Excluding arson attack): Destruction of property, including moveable goods,
                excluding burning.</p>

                <p class="disclaimer-point">7. Arson attack: Destruction of property, including moveable goods by burning/throwing petrol bomb.</p>

                <p class="disclaimer-point">8. High and low impact bombing: Setting off an explosive device (e.g. cocktail, car bomb) causing
                or aimed to cause small to large-scale destruction or casualties.</p>

                <p class="disclaimer-point">9. Abduction, kidnap, hostage and rape: Kidnapping, abduction and hostage indicates that the captive is
                held at the same or unknown locations. Rape is conducting any sexual activities against at least one of
                the participants’ will.</p>

                <p class="disclaimer-point">10. Other types of political violence: This category includes incidences in which actors or perpetrators
                are unspecified or not mentioned.</p>

                <p>Using newspapers as a data source is potentially controversial. Yet there are limited other data sources
                providing wide ranging coverage of events. While watchdog institutions like Freedom House are critical
                of press freedom in Bangladesh, they also state that print media is given relatively more scope to publish
                freely (Freedom House 2015). A number of caveats and safeguards apply to accurately interpret the
                results under PMRD database.</p>
                <p>First, quite narrow definition of political violence was taken, focusing on ‘organisational’ violence.
                This is to minimize the interpretation of what connotes ‘political’.</p>
                <p>Second, our estimates for lethal casualties and wounded are expected to be conservative. The coding
                protocol</p>
                specifies that, in the case of uncertainty, the lowest possible number should be recorded.
                <p>Third, we have a regional bias by using the Dhaka editions of our four newspapers. Three of the
                newspapers have regional editions that include additional news about a specific region.</p>
